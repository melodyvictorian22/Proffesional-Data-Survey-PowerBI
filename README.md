# Interpretting Dashboards with PowerBI
This is a dashboard that I make in PowerBI using dataset Proffesional Data Survey that I took from Alex Freberg on Youtube to complete Data Analyst Bootcamp.

Link Dataset : https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx

### The Step involved in the analysis :
1. Data Extraction: Getting the data from an Excel sheet to Power Query.
2. Data Cleaning: Checking for duplicate values, errors, and patterns.
3. Data Transformation: Filtering data values and adding new calculated measures such as Average Salary.
5. Data Processing/Manipulation: Creating new measures including Count of Data Professionals, and Average Salary.
6. Data Visualization: Building an interactive dashboard with charts, cards and many more.
